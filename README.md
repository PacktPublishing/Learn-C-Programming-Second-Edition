## Errata

* **Page 57:** The sentences
  > The set of values a byte can represent is 256 or [28]() values. These values range from 0 to 255 or [28–1](). 0 is a value that must be represented in the set of 256 values; we can't leave that value out. A byte can either represent a positive integer ranging from 0 to 255, or [28–1](), or a negative integer ranging from -128 to 127.

  leave out proper superscripts. They should be
  > The set of values a byte can represent is 256 or [2<sup>8</sup>]() values. These values range from 0 to 255 or [2<sup>8</sup>–1](). 0 is a value that must be represented in the set of 256 values; we can't leave that value out. A byte can either represent a positive integer ranging from 0 to 255, or [2<sup>8</sup>–1](), or a negative integer ranging from -128 to 127.

* **Page 62:** The term
  > significand x [baseexponent]()

  leaves out proper superscripting. It should appear as
  > significand x [base<sup>exponent</sup>]()

* **Page 66 & page 69:** There is no `return 0;` in `main()`. There should be a `return 0` statement. The code should appear as

       int main( void )  {
         printSizes();
         return 0;
       }

* **Page 92:** The program `calcLength.c` uses variable names `aValue` and `aLength` whose units are ambiguous. On the repository, these are replaced with `inches` and `totalInches`. This clearly demonstrates the importance of giving variables names that more accurately represent the values they are intended to hold.

* **Page 104:** The declaration and calls to `doubleFunc()` are correct whereas its name in its definition is missing an 'e'. The function should be defined as

        void doubleFunc( double dbl ) {
        ...

* **Page 105:** The format strings of the `printf()` do not match the output shown. The `printf()` format strings should include the expected numerical conversion for the given values. The format strings should have appropriate `"(int)"` or `"(double)"` as follows:

          result = numerator / denominator;
          printf( "Truncation:       (int) %d   /    (int) %d    = %.1g\n\n" ,
                  numerator , denominator , result );

          result = (double) numerator / denominator;
          printf( "No truncation: (double) %.1f /    (int) %d    = %.1f\n" ,
                  (double)numerator , denominator , result );

          result = numerator / (double)denominator;
          printf( "                  (int) %d   / (double) %.1f  = %.1f\n" ,
                  numerator , (double)denominator , result );

* **Page 107:** In code listing for `convertDigitToInt.c`, the line `#include <stdio.h>` is missing before `int main( void )`. It should be the first line of the code listing.

* **Page 109:** In the last paragraph before the code listing, the program name `logical.c` is missing a plural 's'. It should be `logicals.c`.

* **Page 110:** The last `printf()` statement of the function `void printLogicalOR()` shows an incorrect parameter value. It should be

        printf( "  %1d | %1d | %1d\n\n" , o ,  one_zero , one_one  );

* **Page 111:** In the function `main()`, the call shown is `PrintLogicalXOR(...)` whereas it should be initial lowercase, `printLogicalXOR(...)`

* **Page 113:** At the bottom of the page, the declaration of constant values are missing the assignment operator (=). They should be declared as:

        const unsigned char lowercase = 1;
        const unsigned char bold      = 2;
        const unsigned char italic    = 4;
        const unsigned char underline = 8;

* **Page 119:** In code listing for `prefixpostfix.c`, the line `#include <stdio.h>` is missing before `int main( void )  {`. It should be the first line of the code listing.

* **Page 121:** The wrong table has been displayed for *Table 5.1 – Operator precedence table*.<br>
The correct Operator precedence table may be found on Page 660.

* **Page 153:** In the second code snippet, the list operator is incorrectly used when declaring `i` and `j`. The code is shown as

        for( int i = 0 , int j = maxlen ;
             (i < maxlen) && (j > 0);
             i++ , j-- )
        { ... }

  The 2nd `int` should be removed and the snippet should be

        for( int i = 0 , j = maxlen ;
             (i < maxlen) && (j > 0);
             i++ , j-- )
        { ... }

  Note that in this `for()...` declaration, the first `,` is used as a list operator in the 1st line, while in the 3rd line, the `,` is
  used as a sequence operator.

* **Page 170:** The macro symbol `HEART` is incorrectly shown at the bottom of this page. It should be

        int card = HEART;

* **Page 171:** The constant `kHeart` is incorrectly shown in the first code snippet. It should be

        int card = kHeart;

* **Page 198:** The following function is given:

        int sumCards( struct Card c1 , struct Card c2 )  {
          int faceValue = c1.faceFalue + c2.faceValue;
          return faceValue;
        }

  but the intent of the function would be much clearer if the local variable `faceValue` was renamed to `cardSum`:

        int sumCards( struct Card c1 , struct Card c2 )  {
          int cardSum = c1.faceFalue + c2.faceValue;
          return cardSum;
        }

* **Page 202:** In the code listing for the function `addCard()`, the `struct Hand newHand` is incorrectly referred to as `hewHand` (3 occurrences) in the `switch` statement. In each occurrence, the structure name should be `newhand`

* **Page 204:** In the code listing for the function `printHand2()`, the variable `dealt` is declared and in the next line, it is incorrectly referenced as `d`; it should be

          if( dealt == 0 ) return;

* **Page 206:** In the `main()` function code listing, `(int)eJeart` occurs. This should be `(int)eHeart`.

* **Page 229:** In the 3rd paragraph, the sentence should be:
  > The C compiler does not see any difference between a variable and constant variable [after]() they have been declared.

* **Page 230:** The next to last paragraph should read
  > All the values of each array are initialized to 0 when the value given within `{` and `}` is 0,
as in `int a[5] = {0};` otherwise the values are assigned in the sequence given within `{` and `}`,
as in `int b[5] = { 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 }`. Only values given will initialize the corresponding elements; so,
  >  `int c[5] = { 5 , 4 };` initializes onlly the first two elements while the remaining elements are unintialized.

* **Page 252:** The initialization shown for `array3D` is for a 3 x 2 x 5 array.<br>
The initialization for a 3 x 4 x 5 array should appear as

        int array3D[size3d][size2D][size1D] =
          { { { 111 , 112 , 113 , 114 , 115 },
              { 121 , 122 , 123 , 124 , 125 },
              { 131 , 132 , 133 , 134 , 135 },
              { 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 , 145 } },
            { { 211 , 212 , 213 , 214 , 215 },
              { 221 , 222 , 223 , 224 , 225 },
              { 231 , 232 , 233 , 234 , 235 },
              { 241 , 242 , 243 , 244 , 245 } },
            { { 311 , 312 , 313 , 314 , 315 },
              { 321 , 322 , 323 , 324 , 325 },
              { 331 , 332 , 333 , 334 , 335 },
              { 341 , 342 , 343 , 344 , 345 } } };

* **Page 279:** In the code snippet of `main()`, there appears a `]` where there should be none:

        aPtr = &height;

* **Page 286:** Inconsistent indentation of code. Throughout the text, 2 spaces have been used for each level of indentation. Note that the added whitespace, while inconsistent, does not alter program behavior. Consistent whitespace formatting is a desireable programming trait.

* **Page 290:** In the code snippet

        printf( "  address of pDimension = %#lx\n" , (unsigned long) &pDimension );

  uses the `%#lx` format specifier for a pointer variable. Instead, it should use `%p`, as follows:

        printf( "  address of pDimension = %p\n" , &pDimension );

  The latter is both clearer and more correct.

* **Page 293:** In the second paragraph, the dereference operator `->` is incorrectly shown. The text should read
  > This is done using the [`->`]() operator.

* **Page 325:** The text of the last sentence on this page incorrectly shows the range of an `unsigned char`
  > Finally, we declare an unsigned single-byte variable, `aByte`, which can hold a value between 0 and [128]().

  This should be
  > Finally, we declare an unsigned single-byte variable, `aByte`, which can hold a value between 0 and [256]().

* **Page 447:** In the first code snippet, the text
  > `The second is as follows:`

  is shown as source code but it is not. It should be shown as descriptive text:
  > The second is as follows:

* **Page 463:** In the table output for `unsignedIn.c`, "HEX[I]()DECIMAL" should be "HEX[A]()DECIMAL"

* **Page 483:** In the last paragraph, [`getopt)`]() function call is missing an open parantheses. It should be [`getopt()`]()

* **Page 489:** In the table, the cell in the 4th row and 5th column shows the incorrect function
  > [scanf()]()

  when the function should be
  > [sscanf()]()

* **Page 504:** In the 3rd paragraph, it reads
  > The following program reads a group of digits, each of which is intended to represent a date—[the first four digits for the year, the next two for the month, and the last two for the day]():

  This should read
  > The following program reads a group of digits, each of which is intended to represent a date—[the first two digits for the month, the next two for the day and the last four digits for the year]():

* **Page 532:** In the source code listing where `outputFilename` is opened, `ERROR: input file` is shown in the error message instead of `ERROR: output file`, as follows:

          if( NULL == outputFile )  {
            fprintf( stderr, "ERROR: output file: [%s]: %s\n",
                     outputFilename , strerror( errno ) );
            exit( EXIT_FAILURE );
          }

* **Pages 544-545:** In the source code listing for `trimStr()`, there is inconsistent naming of the variables `pStr` (should not be `pString`) and `tmpStr` (should not be `tmpString`). The function `trimStr()` should thus appear as follows:

        int trimStr( char* pStr )  {
          size_t first , last , lenIn , lenOut ;
          first = last = lenIn = lenOut = 0;

            lenIn = strlen( pStr );   //
            char tmpStr[ lenIn+1 ];   // Create working copy.
            strcpy( tmpStr , pStr );  //
            char* pTmp = tmpStr;      // pTmp may change in Left Trim segment.

              // Left Trim
              // Find 1st non-whitespace char; pStr will point to that.
            while( isspace( pTmp[ first ] ) )
              first++;
            pTmp += first;

            lenOut = strlen( pTmp );     // Get new length after Left Trim.
            if( lenOut )  {              // Check for empty string.
                                         //  e.g. "   " trimmed to nothing.
                // Right Trim
                // Find 1st non-whitespace char & set NUL character there.
              last = lenOut-1;           // off-by-1 adjustment.
              while( isspace( pTmp[ last ] ) )
                last--;
              pTmp[ last+1 ] = '\0';  // Terminate trimmed string.
            }
            lenOut = strlen( pTmp );  // Length of trimmed string.
            if( lenIn != lenOut )     // Did we change anything?
              strcpy( pStr , pTmp );  // Yes, copy trimmed string back.
            return lenOut;
          }

* **Page 547:** In the source code snippet to declare the `nameBuffer` array, the symbol `stringMax` is incorrect; it should be `kStringMax` as follows:

        char nameBuffer[ kStringMax ];

* **Page 548:** In the source code listing for the function `int getName(...)`, the parameters to the functions `memset()` and  `fgets()` are incorrect. Instead of `stringMax`, they should be `kStringMax` as follows:

          memset( pStr , 0 , kStringMax );
          ...
          fgets( pStr , kStringMax , inFileDesc );

* **Page 551:** In the code snippet for `sortNames.c`, two functions at the bottom of the page show incorrect function signatures for those functions.
    Each function takes a pointer to `nameList`. They pass in `nameList` when they should pass in `&nameList` and should appear as follows:

          PrintNames( outputFile , &nameList );
          DeleteNames( &nameList );
